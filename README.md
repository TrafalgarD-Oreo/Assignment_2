🎓 Vault of Codes: Internship Programs Landing Page
This repository contains the frontend code for a responsive landing page designed to showcase the various Internship Programs offered by "Vault of Codes."

The page acts as a catalog, utilizing a clean, modern design and clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs) to guide students toward enrollment.

✨ Key Features
Program Catalog: Clear presentation of four distinct technical programs: Web Development, App Development, Python, and Java.

Responsive Grid Layout: Uses CSS Grid with a fallback to a single-column layout on smaller screens to ensure an optimal viewing experience on all devices.

Modern UI/UX: Implements a professional color scheme (white/blue accent) with hover effects and soft box-shadows on the program cards for visual depth and interactivity.

Custom Fonts: Imports Google Fonts (Roboto Slab, Rubik, Inter) for enhanced typographical appeal.

🛠️ Technology Stack
HTML5: Structure and content organization.

CSS3: Styling, including CSS Grid for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and custom styles for buttons and cards.

JavaScript (ES6): Used for minor interactive features (e.g., the welcome alert on the button click).

📐 Project Structure
The project is contained within a single index.html file, where all CSS is embedded in the <style> block for easy demonstration and deployment as a single-page static site.
